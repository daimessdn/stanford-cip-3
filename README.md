This repository contains all of my assignments and personal projects based on **Code In Place 2023**.

**Code in Place** is a free introductory programming course using Python language based on material from the first half of **Stanford University**'s established intro course, **CS106A**. Code is Place is free and run by volunteers who are eager to teach in programming language, especially Python.
